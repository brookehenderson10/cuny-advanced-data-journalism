We also received conflicting contact addresses. 

XXXX aka XXXX XXXX, was obligated under the RMBS agreement to offer relief for debts they purchased from XXXX, instead committed modification fraud, false attempts at modification, lied to us, threatened us inappropriately, falsely sent an appraiser, who told us she had been hired to take photos to sell the house, not appraise. etc.. started foreclosure proceedings while they were pretending to negotiate a settlement, falsely appraised property ignoring legal issues attached, and boundary disputes, and threatened to sell our home, falsely reported amounts owed to credit bureau, and finally sold the "" debt '' wildly false amount to different entities, who are now both harassing us, and threatening foreclosure, and XXXX never notified us that they had sold us, until a month after the alleged sales of the same debt to two different trusts?

The Plaintiff is identified as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). The debt collector is identified as the "" law Firm '' attempting to Foreclose on my property. 

I am questioning if the debt collector bought the debt can he legally use the bank 's name as the Plaintiff on the Foreclosure document? 

Second question is if he didn't buy the debt, must he obtain authorization from XXXX  to pursue the Foreclosure action in court or can the debt collector file the Foreclosure document on his own and be the beneficiary of owning the home if his court case is decided in his favor? 

Clearly, foreclosing on a home is not collecting a debt, which is monetary.

My goal for case # XXXX was to make a negotiated payment amount, given the one and a half years invested to find the "" loan '' account. I wanted to know how to negotiate to pay off the amount, as well as, an explanation as to why my checking overdraft was listed as a mortgage loan. I do not own property. No resolution and my case was closed. 

What transpired : I was resent a letter from XX/XX/2017. The reissue and XXXX of letter was not necessary, given I had already invested 6 hours in calling the CHASE phone numbers listed on the letter in XX/XX/2017 at which time the contacts ( again ) could not find my account so that I could begin to pay. My financial counselor recommended I file complaint after she, her supervisor and myself spent over a year connecting with a CHASE representatives. 

The last few months have been spent leaving phone messages at XXXX XXXX for : ext XXXX & ext XXXX. I have repeatedly asked for a time I could call them. 

The amount owed is {$1600.00} less fees. 

Chase has not helped me find the "" mortgage account '' to pay off or negotiate the amount to clear my credit score. 

Rough itemization of my time invested to make good on my misfiled, lost debt is approximately 50 -  60 hours at $ XXXX/hr {$3700.00} - {$4500.00}. I have a log of my time invested. I would like my {$1600.00} debt cleared off all four of the credit bureaus. I have tried to do the right thing and pay my {$1600.00} debt, however none of the employees I have spoken with can find the account or let me know with whom I can negotiate a revised amount or resolve in another way. 

I am most disappointed by the ineptitude of SALARIED employees, their inability to help me finalize my debt and clear my credit for a new future. My initial debt came from numerous stressful situations surrounding my own health, caring for my mentally ill mother and her untimely death. ( see first complaint letter case # XXXX ). 

My only recourse is to photocopy a year and a half worth of Chase form letters, "" documentation '' received and my journal of phone logs to XXXX a package to XXXX XXXX, CEO of JP Morgan Chase for his the executive assistant to "" escalate ''. My experience with CHASE will make an excellent case study of the aftermath of mortgage crises, an individual consumer experience.
