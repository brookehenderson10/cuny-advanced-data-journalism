Now I will no longer know if they have received and posted my payment or have any balance information given to me like they use to and I believe this is unfair. The company claims they want to cut down on sending paper statements. Now I will loose all track of payments and balance history unless I call them monthly or request a payment history which means they will have to send paperwork anyway so this is unfair and makes no sense. This kind of behavior with these companies has to be stopped.

2018-10-23T00:00:00.000,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"i, a woman in flesh and blood purchased a home on XX/XX/2018 in XXXX XXXX NV. The original lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX whom was paid in full. On or about XX/XX/2018 approximately three months later a new company came on the scene requesting payments for a debt. That company name is XXXX XXXX XXXX located in California. Since the inception of the purchase the questions where asked as follows ; "" Have you receive full payment and compensation as agreed upon between buyer XXXX XXXX XXXX and lender XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX? '' That answer was yes. The next question that was asked, then where is the proof of payment received type of currency needed and on what date. That question was not answered. On or about XX/XX/2018 i received a letter from a company located in XXXX XXXX CA stating that they where the new lender of my alleged mortgage. i responded immediately asking them to validate and varify the alleged mortgage note and or security. i asked how did you become the lender when i never met with anyone from XXXX XXXX XXXX nor with XXXX XXXX a none profit corporation whom came on the scene around XX/XX/2018 claiming they too where the original lender. i responded the same with "" please provide any and all communications in person with anyone living in flesh and blood of the same kind that alleges this debt. The persons addressed are the CEO 's of both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, they the CEO 's never responded. Rather a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX named XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX XXXX from the same Research Department PennyMac Loan Services, LLC from the "" Research Department PennyMac Loan Services, LLC '' stating that they are both the lender and the servicer. As well they made changes to their claims stating that XXXXXXXX XXXX is the lender, when all of this is false. The lender was and only XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX NV. They failed to answer the letters in a timely manner. i personally mailed them notification that the debt was being disputed due to the new and false information regarding my purchased home. Each time they would continue to send letters well after i mailed a cease and desist notice to them on XXXX showing that the debt was being disputed due to false information, lack of accurate information and the history tied thereto the purchase. i have yet to receive any response from the CEO 's of all companies involved as well from the CEO of the true and original lender whom was paid that being XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They continue XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX through Penny Mac insisting that a debt is owed without proof, wet signatures and verification and validation. Such is fraud, extortion, harassment, slander defamation and libel. Now the facts remain un-rebutted such as, verification and validation of the alleged debt, failure to respond by the CEO 's whom the letters where addressed thereto, and not any other. No wet signature produce, and upon the documents presented by Penny Mac and XXXX XXXX have issues that should have been corrected before this time of the complaint filed here and now. Also they failed to state who is XXXX XXXX and why the name change? They failed to prove that a debt exist and any use of XXXX XXXX XXXX be it lower case and or all capital is copyright infringement and an attempt to create a dead corporation in my name without my consent or knowledge of such. The signatures do not match that of XXXX XXXX XXXX please Cc the Certificate Of Administrative Judgement via USPS registered mail. For all other questions comments and concerns please see the attachments hereto this complaint. Also the language within the produced alleged mortgage agreement is not in english, does not make sense, unclear, and has multiple issues that needed to have been corrected before now, and they have failed to do so.",,"PENNYMAC LOAN SERVICES, LLC.",NV,891XX,Consent provided,Web,2018-10-23T00:00:00.000,Closed with explanation,Yes,,N/A,3054655
