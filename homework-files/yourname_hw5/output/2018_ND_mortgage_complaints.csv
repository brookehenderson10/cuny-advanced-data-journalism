2018-12-13T00:00:00.000,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"I went into the automated system to make my mortgage payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. I completed it and heard a confirmation number. I was driving and could not right the number down. I received a collection call the first week of XXXX. The person from Penny Mac said they needed to talk about my account and asked from my SSN. I asked why they needed to discuss my account and they said they needed to verify my SSN first. I refused, as I assumed this was a scam. 

I was called today XX/XX/XXXX. The person asked for my address. I provided it and apparently the automated system made and error ant the payment wasn't recorded. I immediately pooled up my account and verified the payment wasn't withdrawn. I paid the past due amount immediately on the phone. I asked them if they could make sure this late would not report to my credit. They refused to acknowledge the systems error. They could see I called in to the system on the XXXX. I have a perfect pay history. They also could see I call in the same time every month to make the payment, but said the could do nothing about it. They offered the address to file a written complaint, but by then the damage will be done and she reitterated they can't change the credit. They could report this to the credit as their system error. They just won't. I now will suffer a 30 day mortgage late on my credit.
