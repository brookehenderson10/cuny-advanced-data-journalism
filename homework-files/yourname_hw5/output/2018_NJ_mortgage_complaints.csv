2018-02-20T00:00:00.000,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"This is complicated. But we can afford to pay our mortgage so why can't we? 

I have been living in my home paying a mortgage/rent for 15 years. I fell into hard times in XXXX and my father in law bought the house from the bank for us to save it and to reduce monthly costs. I continued paying the entire mortgage to the bank each month until XXXX. In XXXX my father in law did a loan modification with the bank to lower monthly costs. The monthly mortgage rate would now be {$1800.00}. We did those payments for the required 4 months. Next the bank just needed a signed approval form on the new Mortgage rate. The Bank said they sent it to our location XXXX XXXX, but we never got it. We called the bank they said they could not resend it because it was past the due date and they would not take our monthly payment. I do not have anything but verbal proof of this. 

I hired a lawyer after 2 months of no communication with Bank of America, BOA. My lawyer = the XXXX XXXX XXXX who specializes in Loan Modification Specialties. 

At the same time my father in law XXXX XXXX. He left the house to his estate, my husband and his two sisters. The two sisters wanted us to keep the house just as we wanted to keep the house. We told the bank what happened and they said we had to Short Sale the home. But why, no one would tell me my options== bank of america made us contact so many departments, and everywhere was no help.We couldn't get anyone at BOA to speak to us so I had to leave it all to our Legal Group , assigning them that right.

The Legal Group said we should try for an Assumption plan to get approved. We were trying to do a Loan Modification through a different department too, but we were not getting any where. We were denied for the Loan Modification, the bank said because the owner died. But we wanted to save the house. My legal group said it wouldn't work. So in the mean time we continued to try to get the Assumption Plan passed, that took 2 years! Why so long, finally We had been sent in XX/XX/XXXX a foreclosure notice from the courts from BOA, Foreclosure date : XX/XX/XXXX Auction date. 

Then still pending any notice from BOA, weeks before foreclosure, we finally get denied for the Assumption Plan. No reason attached. But my lawyer said they wanted us to pay XXXX to do the Assumption Plan. At that time we had not that amount in our bank, I had to time to prepare. We assume that is why BOA denied us but we could have gotten that amount if we had, had time or if we knew who to speak to. 

Then our Legal Group said we should apply for a mortgage and buy out the home from BOA. We only had 3 weeks to save the home. Everything was going good until the under-writer said my husband was on the deed to the home and we no longer can apply for a mortgage ( you can not buy something you own ). No one asked us about the deed, but our Legal Group knew all our history. Why couldn't the BOA or even our Legal Group tell us that, or even help us with options to save our home.

Our Legal Group has been through so many departments but I feel they are not concentrating on my case, I did however pay them a lot of money. I have tried to contact the bank on my own but they will not speak to me without my Legal Group on the phone. BOA said I need to fill out a Seize and Desist letter, eliminating my Legal Groups ' help. At this time, I am scared to do that. I do not want to loose my home. And I do not want to eliminate help. 

I gave in writing a letter to BOA allowing my Legal Group all access to my case, I gave BOA the Legal Groups phone number and their address instructing BOA to send all correspondence and phone calls to the Legal Group, still they are not sending everything to them. 

On XX/XX/XXXX BOA send a Uniform Borrowers Assistant form to the Executor of my husbands ' fathers Estate. Which is his sister who wrote a letter to BOA relinquishing all her rights ( in the very beginning of this problem ), telling the bank to send all documents to the Legal Group and me, my address. They still don't abide. Now I have a new foreclosure date of XX/XX/XXXX, I do not have much time. And what is this Uniform Borrowers form?, well my Legal Group says its a Loan Modification form ... .. 

In the beginning, we were denied Loan Modification because they said the Loan and the deed are two separate things. Now they send us this form? This form is different that anything I have gotten before, do I have other options? I have no one to answer these questions. It is attached. 

I do not know what to do at this point. I do not know why we can not speak to someone at BOA who can help us save our home, we just get the run around and I pay for outside help and still get the run around.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NJ,,Consent provided,Web,2018-02-21T00:00:00.000,Closed with explanation,Yes,,N/A,2820511

First and foremost, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  commenced a foreclosure debt collection action by complaint filed with the Superior Court of New Jersey, and shortly thereafter, submitted the first of three instruments asserted to be a true copy of the original note in dispute, wherein there was no indorsements by XXXX as the original payee upon the instrument ( See Exhibit 1 ).

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) seized XXXX, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) became the receiver and entered into a Purchase & Assumption Agreement ( P & AA ) the same day with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), the latter of whom has confirmed in multiple court proceedings and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that the aforementioned XXXX XXXX XXXX only transferred servicing of residential mortgage loans serviced by XXXX  prior to its receivership on XX/XX/XXXX, and not ownership of the underlying loans that were already securitized.

Thus from the inception of the aforementioned foreclosure action commenced in the year XX/XX/XXXX throughout the mid-point of year XX/XX/XXXX, there were no ( emphasis added ) instrument recorded by the Office of the Clerk for XXXX   County, NJ ( XXXX County Clerk ) asserting a transfer of my mortgage loan from XXXX to the FDIC, XXXX, or any other parties for XXXX remained the mortgagee of record, and the only ( emphasis added ) note instrument submitted into the Superior Court of New Jersey up to that moment, was still payable to XXXX ( See Exhibit 1 ).

Then, onXX/XX/XXXX, foreclosure attorneys XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) out of XXXX, NJ filed a Certification In Support of Proceeding With Foreclosure Notwithstanding Lack of Assignment of Mortgage and enclosed Exhibit A which is a note instrument certified to be a true copy of the original that I signed on XX/XX/XXXX, and there are no ( emphasis added ) indorsements by XXXX as the original payee upon the instrument ( See Exhibit 2 ).

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, Seterus created and caused to be recorded by the XXXX County Clerk two out of sequence, forged, falsely acknowledged, and void instruments titled NEW JERSEY ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE that serve as the basis of Seterus purported right to deny me a modification to save my home from the Sheriff Scheduled on XX/XX/XXXX, wherein : 1. the first of two instruments recorded electronically at XXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/XXXX, misrepresents that XXXX   transferred my mortgage ( without any mention of a transfer of the note ) to XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 3 ), before the recording of the last of two instruments recorded electronically the same date at XXXX XXXX. misrepresenting that XXXX   as the purported attorney-in-fact for the FDIC transferred my mortgage ( without any mention of a transfer of the note ) to XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 4 ). ; 2. there is no proof or evidence that the FDIC owned or took possession of my mortgage loan. ; 3. there is no proof that the FDIC authorized XXXX  to act as the FDICs attorney in fact as of XX/XX/XXXX. ; AND 4. XXXX   already admitted under oath in court proceedings and filings with the SEC that that the aforementioned XXXX XXXX XXXX  only transferred servicing of residential mortgage loans serviced by XXXX prior to its receivership on XX/XX/XXXX, and not ownership of the underlying loans that were already securitized.

Additionally, the aforementioned void and out of sequence instruments titled NEW JERSEY ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE that were created by Seterus, and recorded by the XXXX County Clerk on XX/XX/XXXX( See Exhibits 3 and 4 ), and heavily relied upon by Seterus as the purported servicing agent for XXXX XXXX, displays general misrepresentations as to the alleged transfer of my mortgage loan, the names and alleged signatures of fictitious persons misrepresenting their identities and knowledge as to the whereabouts of my mortgage loan, and a false acknowledged by a notary public employed by XXXX, all of which constitutes continued violations of the prohibitions under 1. the XX/XX/XXXX consent judgment In the Matter of : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( XXXX  ) ( See Exhibit 5 ). ; AND 2. theXX/XX/XXXX National Mortgage Settlement ( NMS ) ( See Exhibit 6 ) wherein XXXX  and its affiliates were prohibited from further engagement in the unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices cited by the United States of America and 49 State Attorney Generals ( including the New Jersey Attorney General ) in United States of America v. Bank of America Corporation , et al. ( Case No. XXXX ) ( See Exhibit 7 ) for which I was made a party to the action by the New Jersey Attorney General ( NJ AG ) pursuant to consumer enforcement authorities bestowed upon the NJ AG along with parens patriae and common law.

Arguably, the most egregious example of Seterus unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices is displayed within the application for Entry of Final Judgment submitted to the Superior Court of New Jersey on XX/XX/XXXX, wherein a suddenly appearing undated stamp presented as an indorsement in blank by XXXX appears ( See Exhibit 2A ), after ( emphasis added ) the same indorsement in blank did not exist on the alleged true copies of my note that were previously filed in the same foreclosure action in the year of XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 1 ) and again on XX/XX/XXXX as Exhibit A ( See Exhibit 2 ). Furthermore, because of the foregoing facts, coupled with the XX/XX/XXXX deposition of XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. v. XXXX XXXX, et al. ( Case No. : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) ) in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   for XXXX  County, Florida, annexed hereto as Exhibit 2B, Seterus and or its predecessor XXXX illegally affixed the undated stamp ( i.e. not an original blue ink signature ) upon a counterfeit note instrument, constituting continued unlawful practices prohibited by the XX/XX/XXXXNational Mortgage Settlement ( See Exhibit 6 ).

Next, although Seterus is claiming that XXXX XXXX is the owner of my mortgage loan, I have never ( emphasis added ) received a Notice of Sale / Transfer as required under 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ) from any party ( emphasis added ) including Seterus and or XXXX XXXX, asserting to be the new creditor for my mortgage loan that was originally made payable to XXXX XXXX.

XXXX, setting aside the aforementioned grave concerns regarding my mortgage loan and if Seterus has any right to foreclose on behalf of XXXX XXXX, I am extremely concerned that Seterus denied me a modification and has chosen instead to proceed with the Sheriff Sale of my property scheduled forXX/XX/XXXX.

Wherefore, I am now putting the CFPB on notice with this communication and exhibits annexed hereto in support, of Seterus unfair, deceptive, and unlawful practices including the unlawful foreclosure of my property and the unfair denial of a modification that I desperately need and deserve ( in light of the aforementioned document irregularities ) in order to prevent the unnecessary and unjust Sheriff Sale of my property scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX.

2018-05-31T00:00:00.000,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Predatory lending is any lending practice that imposes unfair or abusive loan terms on a borrower. It is also any practice that convinces a borrower to accept unfair terms through deceptive, coercive, exploitative or unscrupulous actions for a loan that a borrower doesn't need, doesn't want or can't afford. This is exactly what XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Beneficial ) is guilty of in the case of my now deceased parents, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. CFPBs job is to protect consumers from this type of abuse when it is reported. I ask that CFPB hold Beneficial, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX accountable for their unconscionable actions. Although too late for my parents, I hope appropriate action by the authorities will prevent thousands of other consumers from being financially destroyed by these unscrupulous and repulsive financial and servicing institutions. Background : On XX/XX/XXXX loan # XXXX was established between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the principle amount of {$32000.00}. The term of the loan was for 180 months with an astonishing high interest rate of 17.895 % ( Risk Based Pricing ). After reviewing the documentation regarding this loan provided by Beneficial, I have discovered the following unethical, or even perhaps illegal discrepancies. Discrepancy # 1 : Beneficial states, Please note that we are unable to provide the origination Appraisal for loan # XXXX ( formerly XXXX ) as it is not available. Therefore, Beneficial unethically lent money to a consumer without an appraisal for a property they were seeking a security interest in? I constitute that as predatory, or at least negligent. Discrepancy # 2 : On the Loan Repayment and Security Agreement ( Page 1 of 3 ), the property address is listed as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX, with the loan number being XXXX. This is neither the correct loan number nor is the property address zip code for XXXX XXXX, its XXXX. Note Beneficial states, You are giving us a security interest in the real estate located at the above address. This cant be the case, as that address does not exist. Discrepancy # 3 : The Truth-In-Lending Disclosure ( Page 1 of 2 ) contains the wrong address and loan number. Also, the Annual Percentage rate is an astonishing 19.001 % ( predatory ). Discrepancy # 4 : Loan Summary page contains the wrong property address. Discrepancy # 5 : XXXX XXXX credit report contains the wrong birthdates of both my parents. They ran a report for my father as XXXX XXXX. His name is XXXX XXXX, not XXXX XXXX and wrong birth date. They even disregarded four ( 4 ) XXXX alerts on the report. Instead of running a credit report for my mother ( co-signer ), they erroneously ran a credit report for a XXXX XXXX. The report had wrong name, wrong SS #, wrong birthdate and wrong address. Discrepancy # 5 : The Good Faith Estimate ( Page 1 of 2 ) did not disclose all charges. In all, they were charged {$1800.00} of excessive fees. Discrepancy # 6 : Title report was ran by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on property with Deed dated XX/XX/XXXX,  recorded XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Page 770. This is the legal description used in both the note and mortgage filed in XXXX County, NY. On XX/XX/XXXX loan # XXXX ( which is crossed out and replaced with XXXX ) was established between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the principle amount of {$62000.00}. The term of the loan was for 240 months with an astonishing high interest rate of 11.540 % ( Risk Based Pricing/Loan Flipping ), with the following discrepancies : Discrepancy # 1 : Loan Repayment and Security Agreement ( Page 1 of 3 ) contains the wrong property address. Again, they state, You are giving us a security interest in the real estate located at the above address. Thats impossible, because it is incorrect. Discrepancy # 2 : The Truth-In-Lending Disclosure ( Page 1 of 3 ) contains the wrong property address. Discrepancy # 3 : The Loan Summary contains the wrong property address. Discrepancy # 4 : The credit reports ran contain the wrong birthdates of my parents. XXXX alerts were discarded. Discrepancy # 5 : The Good Faith Estimate contains the wrong property address, as well as discloses misleading, repetitive and excessive fees that my parents were charged for just six months earlier. Discrepancy # 6 : The Settlement Statement contains the wrong property address and charges my parents an astonishing {$4100.00} in settlement charges. This totals a sum of {$6000.00} in charges over a six-month period. Discrepancy # 7 : Title report was ran by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on property with Deed dated XX/XX/XXXX, recorded XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Page 770. This is the legal description used in both the note and mortgage filed in XXXX County, NY. Discrepancy # 8 : The Uniform Residential Appraisal Report does not match the legal description of the deed ran by the Title Company. Also, it only states the address as XXXX and later in the report as XXXX XXXX. XXXX. Discrepancy # 9 : The Mortgage and Consolidation Agreement attached contain the wrong property address. The zip code for XXXX is listed as XXXX. XXXX zip code is XXXX. Discrepancy # 10 : The Optional Credit Insurance Disclosure contains the wrong address. The loans listed above were then consolidated by Beneficial on XX/XX/XXXX in the sum of {$110000.00} and riddled with similar discrepancies and fraudulent behavior, which I have previously reported to no avail. After my parents passing, Beneficial fraudulently sold these deficient and unenforceable loans to XXXX XXXX XXXXt XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and transferred the serving to XXXX. XXXX and XXXX continue to try to enforce these unenforceable loans and threaten my parents estate with foreclosure. I would like to see the appropriate action taken against these institutions and for them to admit their wrongdoings and cease and desist their present actions. It is obvious Beneficial partook in predatory, unethical and fraudulent behavior and took advantage of my parents unsophisticated and uneducated financial literacy. Beneficial has the documentation I have cited, as they provided it to me. They need to be held accountable, cure the loans with XXXX and discharge the erroneous records filed in XXXX   County, NY Land Records. As such, on behalf of my parents estate, I continue to dispute all alleged debt associated with XXXX account XXXX.

A propertys legal description identifies it and distinguishes it from any other property. An error in the legal description of record becomes an obvious title issue and has a significant effect on any applicable documented agreements. In this case, three recorded defective mortgages. As outlined in attached, the clear and convincing evidence provided illustrates that both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lack of quality control procedures, due diligence, breach of representation and warranties, attention to detail, unethical business practices and non-compliance with relevant underwriting guidelines and applicable laws has rendered all three notes and mortgage agreements ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) completely invalid and unenforceable. Both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX conduct is indicative of fraud on borrowers, fraud on investors and a fraud on the courts ; especially when wrongful notifications and summons for foreclosure are brought forth by both parties without having clear and convincing evidence of a bona fide security interest in a property. In several ways, both companies negligently originated, recorded, serviced, securitized and/or sold these significantly defective loans to the secondary market, which are predominantly and legally null and void.

They told me Bayview Loan Servicing had been making my premium payments and that XXXX XXXX XXXX was my investor and that my PMI premiums went from {$240.00} a month to {$73.00} a month. When I asked why they had changed, they stated that after having a mortgage for 10 years the premium goes down to .02 % of the original loan amount, which is {$440000.00}. I mentioned the loan was discharged in Chapter XXXX on XXXX of XXXX and that this was not the contract that I had with them. In my contract, premiums would stop when I met 80 % of the Loan to Value or on XX/XX/XXXX, based on the amortization schedule.

Complaint # 1 : On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response concerning a CFPB complaint from both SPS and XXXX ( see attached ). Within those responses were copies of a document, entitled Loan Modification, dated XX/XX/XXXX. The ONLY signature on the document was my deceased fathers, which he dated XX/XX/XXXX. My deceased mothers signature block contained the word Deceased. In addition, the document included a stamp on the first page that stated, Received Express Carrier XX/XX/XXXX MAILROOM XXXX, FL. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from SPS which contained what appeared to be the same Loan Modification document which I received copies of from SPS and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively. However, upon further review, I could see how it had been fraudulently altered and/or falsified/backdated. The similar Loan Modification document I received on XX/XX/XXXX now contained two additional stamps. One stated, Received Inter-Office Trailing XX/XX/XXXX Capture Center XXXX, FL and the other stated, Vice President and Asst. Secretary, Administrative Services Division of XXXX XXXX XXXX. In addition, this copy of the document now contained the unreadable signature on the Lender signature block, which was dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached copies ). I can only assume these documents were altered sometime after XX/XX/XXXX andXX/XX/XXXX ; more than two years after my father signed the document on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, I deem this fabricated document as null and void.

I advised them I have repeatedly attempted to request information regarding this account, which has only been met with non-compliance, insufficiency, vagueness, and misrepresentation and unconscionable deceit. Therefore, I have little interest in any work-outs regarding this account until such time it can be proven to me that the alleged obligations you claim are legal and enforceable. Therefore, at this time, I rescind all verbal and written offers to cure this alleged obligation. I fully dispute the validity of the alleged debt, ( current and future ), regarding account number XXXX, as claimed by Select Portfolio Services , Inc. and any associates. I have never sought approval of any modification and had never sent them an application for approval of a modification.

Washington, D.C. XXXX Re : Unfair, deceptive, and unlawful mortgage servicing, dual tracking, and foreclosure practices by Seterus, Inc. and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX pertaining to the subject property XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX ( Loan Acct. # : XXXX ) ( Foreclosure Docket No. : XXXX ) To whom it may concern, I am writing this correspondence to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to report the unfair, deceptive, and unlawful practices by Seterus, Inc. ( Seterus ) as the purported servicer for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) who Seterus claims is the owner of my mortgage loan that was originated on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX   XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), and was previously serviced by the infamous XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( XXXX ). I also submit this communication as an official appeal under 12 CFR 1024.41 ( h ) of Seterus denial of my modification request as of XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 1 ) considering the aforementioned discrepancies, unethical, and unlawful practices putting into question if Seterus has any right to commence the current foreclosure action on behalf of XXXX XXXX as the purported owner of my mortgage loan. 

First and foremost, I have attached to this correspondence as Exhibit 2 a note instrument that was filed with the Superior Court of New Jersey by XXXX on or about XX/XX/XXXX in Docket No. : XXXX, wherein my social security number is unredacted on page two of two, exposed to the general public, and has yet to be redacted by Seterus and or XXXX XXXX, leaving me vulnerable to identity theft and the unlawful trafficking of my personal information by any individual and or company with bad intentions. 

Furthermore, I am even more concerned with the undisputable fact that Seterus as the alleged servicer for XXXX XXXX, is basing its right to deny me modification relief or, in the alternative, continue with the Sheriff Sale of my home on XX/XX/XXXX based upon forged, falsely acknowledged, and or void instruments, of which includes : 1. A forged instrument titled ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE that was created by XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a/k/a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ), and recorded by the Office of the Clerk for XXXX County, NJ ( XXXX County Clerk ) on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 4 ), wherein XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( XXXX ) as the purported nominee for XXXX  XXXX  is misrepresented as the assignor of my mortgage loan on XX/XX/XXXX, when in fact : A. XXXX never extended its monies to me because XXXX does not originate mortgage loan. ; B. XXXX never acquired my mortgage loan, and had no rights to receive payment. ; C. XXXX never acted a document custodian for my mortgage loan, and was contractually prohibited from taking any action ( i.e. foreclosure, assignment, etc. ) on my mortgage loan. ; AND D. the names and purported signatures of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX appearing as officers of XXXX, along with the acknowledged of Minnesota notary public XXXX XXXX, are each forgeries because : i. XXXX   has never ( emphasis added ) had any employees ; AND ii. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were at all times employees of XXXX, the latter of whom entered into a consent order with Federal Authorities on XX/XX/XXXX in In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, et al. ( FRB Docket Nos. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX OCC XXXX XXXX XXXX ) annexed hereto as Exhibit 8, along with XXXX and its parent company in In the Matter of : XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( OCC XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Docket Nos. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX No. XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) annexed hereto as Exhibit 9,  prohibiting their further engagement in the unsound and unsafe practices displayed within the forged instrument still being used by Seterus and XXXX XXXX to foreclose upon my home. ; AND 2. A forged and out of sequence instrument titled NEW JERSEY ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE that was created by XXXX, and recorded by the XXXX County Clerk on XX/XX/XXXX, wherein XXXX XXXX is declared the assignor of only ( emphasis added ) my mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 10 ), without any mention of a transfer of the note in dispute, and without any proof as to when and how WMB as the prior assignee of record according to the aforementioned void instrument titled ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE recorded by the XXXX County Clerk on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 4 ) transfer my mortgage loan to XXXX, the latter of whom only acquired servicing ( not ownership ) from XXXX pursuant to the XX/XX/XXXX Purchase & Assumption Agreement ( P & AA ) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). ; AND 3. The version note instrument last submitted to the Office of Foreclosure by Seterus as the purported authorized  servicer for XXXX XXXX, displays a suddenly appearing undated stamp ( i.e. not a blue ink signature ) purporting to be an indorsement in blank by XXXX ( See Exhibit 2 ), that did not appear upon the note instrument submitted in the same foreclosure proceeding on or about XX/XX/XXXX that was certified by a New Jersey foreclosure attorney to be a true copy of the original, bearing only one dated stamp purported to be an indorsement by XXXX XXXX paid to the order of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 1 ). 

Additionally, the aforementioned void and out of sequence instrument titled NEW JERSEY ASSIGNMENT OF MORTGAGE that was created by XXXX, recorded by the XXXX County Clerk on XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 10 ), and heavily relied upon by Seterus as the purported servicing agent for XXXX XXXX, displays general misrepresentations as to the alleged transfer of my mortgage loan, the names and alleged signatures of fictitious persons misrepresenting their identities and knowledge as to the whereabouts of my mortgage loan, and a false acknowledged by a notary public employed by XXXX, all of which constitutes continued violations of the prohibitions under 1. the XX/XX/XXXX consent judgment In the Matter of : XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. ( XXXX ) ( See Exhibit 11 ). ; AND 2. the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ( See Exhibit 12 ) wherein XXXX and its affiliates were prohibited from further engagement in the unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices cited by the United States of America and 49 State Attorney Generals ( including the New Jersey Attorney General ) in United States of America vXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX et al. ( Case No. XXXX ) ( See Exhibit 13 )  for which I was made a party to the action by the New Jersey Attorney General ( NJ AG ) pursuant to  consumer enforcement authorities bestowed upon the NJ AG along with parens patriae and common law. 

Next, although Seterus is claiming that XXXX XXXX is the owner of my mortgage loan, I have never ( emphasis added ) received a Notice of Sale / Transfer as required under 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ) from any party ( emphasis added ) including Seterus and or XXXX XXXX, asserting to be the new creditor for my mortgage loan that was originally made payable to XXXX XXXX 

Hence, setting aside the aforementioned grave concerns regarding my mortgage loan and if Seterus has any right to foreclose on behalf of XXXX XXXX, I am extremely concerned that Seterus denied me a modification as of XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit 1 ),  and has chosen instead to proceed with the Sheriff Sale of my home scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Wherefore, I am now putting the CFPB on notice with this communication and exhibits annexed hereto in support, of Seterus unfair, deceptive, and unlawful practices including the unlawful foreclosure of my home and the unfair denial of a modification that I desperately need and deserve ( in light of the aforementioned document irregularities ) in order to prevent the unnecessary and unjust Sheriff Sale of my home scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX.

The first mortgage company just released their lien for {$120000.00} to me because this area in NJ was hit very hard by the crisis. My house is worth MAYBE XXXX at the most.

2018-05-16T00:00:00.000,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Seized or attempted to seize your property,"XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. ( SPS ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Beneficial ), is in violation of conspiracy to commit fraud, deceit, falsification of documents and misrepresentation. Complaint # 1 : On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response concerning a CFPB complaint from both XXXX and Beneficial ( see attached ). Within those responses were copies of a document, entitled Loan Modification, dated XX/XX/XXXX. The ONLY signature on the document was my deceased fathers, which he dated XX/XX/XXXX. My deceased mothers signature block contained the word Deceased. In addition, the document included a stamp on the first page that stated, Received XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from SPS which contained what appeared to be the same Loan Modification document which I received copies of from XXXX and Beneficial on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXrespectively. However, upon further review, I could see how it had been fraudulently altered and/or falsified/backdated. The similar Loan Modification document I received on XX/XX/XXXX now contained two additional stamps. One stated, Received Inter-Office Trailing XX/XX/XXXX Capture Center XXXX, FL and the other stated, Vice President and Asst. Secretary, Administrative Services Division of XXXX XXXX XXXX. In addition, this copy of the document now contained the unreadable signature on the Lender signature block, which was dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached copies ). I can only assume these documents were altered sometime after XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; more than two years after my father signed the document on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, I deem this fabricated document as null and void. Complaint # 2 :  On XX/XX/XXXX in correspondence I received from SPS, they give and address for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Alleged Owner of Note ) as XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX. This contradicts the address XXXX provided me in correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX. In that correspondence they stated the address was XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX Attention : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Complaint # 3 : In numerous correspondences from XXXX they state, Your assigned Relationship Manager is XXXX XXXX. I have yet to hear from this person via telephone or in writing and preliminary investigation indicates that she is not who XXXX states she is. Complaint # 4 : On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from XXXX stating they are, based on a business decision, unable to provide assistance. Not sure what prompted them to think I want or need their assistance. In fact, in my Complaint XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. I advised them I have repeatedly attempted to request information regarding this account, which has only been met with non-compliance, insufficiency, vagueness, and misrepresentation and unconscionable deceit. Therefore, I have little interest in any work-outs regarding this account until such time it can be proven to me that the alleged obligations you claim are legal and enforceable. Therefore, at this time, I rescind all verbal and written offers to cure this alleged obligation. I fully dispute the validity of the alleged debt, ( current and future ), regarding account number XXXX, as claimed by XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX and any associates. I have never sought approval of any modification and had never sent them an application for approval of a modification. I can only assume XXXX is attempting to receive Federally Funded Credit for the false attempt. I have identified many more discrepancies during the course of my investigation that will be revealed at a later date. XXXX and Beneficials unethical and seemingly fraudulent behavior continues unchallenged by the appropriate authorities.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,NJ,08085,Consent provided,Web,2018-05-16T00:00:00.000,Closed with explanation,Yes,,N/A,2908803
