    "The Consumer Finance and Protection Bureau was founded in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. One of the things that they do is collect complaints from consumers about bad banks, lenders and other financial insitutions. This complaint data is available to the public in many forms. While you can download a big, horrible CSV file with _all_ of the data, it's usually easier (for you and your computer's memory storage) to use the API to only get the data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFPB uses [Socrata](https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata) to manage their API, which is a company that helps a lot of public agencies share their data with the rest of the world. The way they have you request for data is kind of funky, but we will perservere together!\n",
